      <h3>History of Nitro the Band!!!</h3>
      <p>In 1987, vocalist Jim Gillette released his debut solo album Proud to Be Loud, which featured contributions from guitarist Michael Angelo Batio and bassist T. J. Racer, the three of whom would later go on to form Nitro. Gillette and Batio had initially met at a beach party, while Racer was introduced to the singer as an attendee of one of his instructional vocal courses. Former Vinnie Vincent Invasion drummer Bobby Rock joined the band shortly thereafter. Speaking about joining the band, Rock recalled that Gillette and Batio recruited him by explaining that they "wanted to record the most over-the-top, in-your-face metal record ever".
